 Initial Setup
For Django to work we need to set up the environment. We are going to need three major things:

Python 3
PostgreSQL database server and pgAdmin
Django
We will also be using a fourth component VSCode, though if you prefer you can use IDLE or another IDE that runs Python.

All the elements except Django are installed in the VM.

They should be installed in this order. All of these elements can be installed on any operating system. We will be using Ubuntu, a Linux OS in our virtual machines, but all the elements can be installed just as easily (more easily, in fact) on WIndows or a Mac.

Python already exists on Ubuntu, but it is the version 2.6. We want python3. (Fortunately, this has already been installed in our VMs.)

If you are running Ubuntu on another machine just run this command to upgrade:

sudo apt-get install python3.6

Python 2.6 will still exist. Ubuntu depends on it, but you can use "python3" to run the new version of python.

Windows installation is easy. If you previously installed python for the ITC 110 class you can just use the current installation. Otherwise, go to https://www.python.org  (Links to an external site.) to download it. You can also download the MAC version there.

PostgreSQL and pgAdmin are easy to install on Windows and the Mac.

For the database server go to https://www.postgresql.org/download/  (Links to an external site.) Follow the instructions for WIndows and Mac.

On Ubuntu, PostgreSQL already exists. It needs to be upgraded and activated

Here are instructions for installation on Ubuntu (Links to an external site.)

The pgAdmin Client is available here https://www.pgadmin.org/download/ (Links to an external site.)

Again the installation on Windows or Mac is relatively easy. Here are the instructions for Ubuntu https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt (Links to an external site.)

Here are instructions (Links to an external site.) for installing Django.

Although this (Links to an external site.) is better for Ubuntu.

VSCode can be found at https://code.visualstudio.com/
